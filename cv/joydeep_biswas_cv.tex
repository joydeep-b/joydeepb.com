%
% My ultimate goal is to have self-sufficient autonomous mobile robots working in human environments,
% performing tasks accurately and robustly. In support of this goal, I am interested in research in
% perception, planning, and control applied to autonomous mobile robots. My research in perception
% involves developing models and representations for a dynamic world, and algorithms to build and
% perform inference based on such models. My interests in planning include motion planning, multi-robot
% coordination, and task-based planning in domains including service mobile robots, and robot soccer.
