Our proposal for creating a new research traineeship program titled "Convergent, Responsible, and Ethical AI Training Experience for Roboticists (CREATE Roboticists)" was
awarded by the NSF! This project at UT Austin, with collaborators [Junfeng Jiao](https://soa.utexas.edu/people/junfeng-jiao), [Luis Sentis](https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/sentis), [Min Kyung Lee](http://minlee.net/), and [Justin Hart](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/people/faculty-researchers/justin-hart) will integrate ethical robotics education, research, and career development. The program will train 32 funded trainees and 150 additional graduate students from the Departments of Aerospace, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering, and Schools of Architecture, Information, and Public Affairs.
