I am always looking for self-motivated students to work on research with me on a
variety of topics, including (but not limited to) perception, planning, and
failure recovery of autonomous mobile robots. Our research is driven primarily
by the end-goal of having autonomous mobile robots deployed over long
time-scales spanning years at a time, in challenging real-world human
environments. I am most interested in _solving problems_, not _promoting
tools_ - this means building or selecting the best tools for the problem, not the most
popular tools of the time. Finally, I am interested in applying our research
to real-world robots, not simulation. My [previous papers]({{ site.baseurl }}{%
link publications.md %}) are representative of the research I work on, and in
particular, [here](//joydeepb.com/Publications/ijcai2019_early_career_spotlight.pdf) is a
summary of much of my research to date.

### Skill Sets

I work with students from many prior backgrounds, including Mathematics,
Physics, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Computer Science.
Students don't need to have a specific degree to be successful in our group,
but they should have a strong mathematical background, an eagerness to learn
new topics, and a willingness to pick up new skills on the fly, including new
programming languages and libraries.

### Prospective PhD Students

Prospective PhD students interested in working with me should apply via the [UT
CS PhD Application](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/graduate/prospective-students/apply) website, and make sure to mention my name in your
application. PhD admissions are made by committee, and I cannot provide insights
into the chances of being accepted. [Mor Harchol-Balter at
CMU](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/) has [an article with some excellent
advice](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/gradschooltalk.pdf) to prospective PhD
applicants - I highly recommend reading it.

### Undergraduates at UT Austin

If you are currently an undergraduate student at UT Austin, and would like to
get some experience working on robotics research, please send me an email.
Please include in your email:
1. Why you wish to work with me,
1. A transcript of your grades and your CV, and
1. A link to previous coding projects (e.g. your GitHub profile).

Please bear in mind that working on robotics research is time-consuming. You
should expect to devote a minimum of 11 hours per week to research.
You will have to sign up for a 3-credit independent study with me to work on
research.
   
Due to the volume of emails I receive in this category, I cannot commit to
replying to every one, but I do read every email. If you do not hear back from
me, I apologize, but it may be that a position is either unavailable at the
moment, or that it is not the best fit.
